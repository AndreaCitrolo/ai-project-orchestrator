# PRD: User Authentication System

**Initiative**: 0001-user-authentication  
**Status**: Example  
**Created**: 2025-10-10

## References

**Project State**: `project-state.md`  
**Target Modules**:
- Authentication System (to be created)
- Database Module (existing)

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive user authentication system with JWT-based authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and secure password management. This system will serve as the foundation for all protected features in the application.

## Goals

1. Enable users to register, login, and logout securely
2. Implement JWT token-based authentication for stateless sessions
3. Support role-based access control with three default roles: Admin, Editor, Viewer
4. Ensure passwords are securely hashed using industry standards
5. Provide middleware for protecting routes and checking permissions

## User Stories

1. **As a new user**, I want to register an account with email and password, so that I can access the application.

2. **As a registered user**, I want to login with my credentials and receive an authentication token, so that I can make authenticated requests.

3. **As an authenticated user**, I want my session to remain valid for 24 hours without re-login, so that I have a seamless experience.

4. **As an admin**, I want to assign roles to users, so that I can control what actions they can perform.

5. **As a developer**, I want to protect API endpoints with authentication middleware, so that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication
1. System must allow users to register with email and password
2. System must validate email format and password strength (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number)
3. System must hash passwords using bcrypt with cost factor 12
4. System must generate JWT tokens on successful login (24h expiry)
5. System must validate JWT tokens on protected endpoints
6. System must support token refresh before expiry
7. System must invalidate tokens on logout

### Authorization
8. System must support role-based access control (RBAC)
9. System must include three default roles: Admin, Editor, Viewer
10. System must allow assigning multiple roles to a user
11. System must provide middleware to check required roles for endpoints
12. System must support permission-based access (resource + action)

### API Endpoints
13. `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
14. `POST /api/auth/login` - Login and receive JWT
15. `POST /api/auth/logout` - Invalidate token
16. `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token
17. `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info
18. `POST /api/auth/roles` - Assign role to user (admin only)

## Non-Goals

- Social authentication (OAuth, Google, Facebook) - future initiative
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) - future initiative
- Password reset functionality - separate initiative
- Account verification via email - separate initiative

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Depends on: `0000-api-framework` (base API setup)
- Depends on: Database setup and migration system

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.11
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- PyJWT (token generation)
- bcrypt (password hashing)
- PostgreSQL

### Database Schema
- `users` table
- `roles` table
- `permissions` table
- `user_roles` junction table
- `role_permissions` junction table

## Project Behavior Specifications

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: All authentication logic, password hashing, token generation/validation
- **Integration Tests**: Complete authentication flows (register → login → access protected endpoint)
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ for authentication module

### Version Control Workflow
- **Branching**: Feature branch `feature/0001-user-authentication` from `main`
- **PR Requirements**: All tests pass, code review from one other developer
- **Merge Strategy**: Squash and merge after approval

### Deployment
- **Approach**: CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- **Environments**: Deploy to staging first, then production after manual approval
- **Database Migrations**: Run automatically in CI/CD pipeline before deployment

### Collaboration Model
- **Agents**: Support for up to 3 agents working in parallel on different task groups
- **Human Review**: Required after each task group completion
- **Branching**: Each agent works on feature branch, rebase before starting new task group

### State Update Timing
- Update project state after Task Group 3 completion (when all core APIs are implemented)
- Final update when initiative is closed

## Success Metrics

1. All users can successfully register and login
2. Token validation works correctly (99.9% success rate)
3. No password leaks or security vulnerabilities
4. Authentication adds <50ms latency to API requests
5. 90%+ test coverage achieved

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can register with email and password
- [ ] Users can login and receive valid JWT token
- [ ] JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- [ ] Tokens can be refreshed before expiry
- [ ] Users can logout and tokens are invalidated
- [ ] Roles can be assigned to users
- [ ] Protected endpoints reject unauthenticated requests
- [ ] Role-based permissions are enforced
- [ ] All tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks?
2. Do we need to support concurrent sessions for a single user?
3. Should we log authentication events for security auditing?
